 * @ingroup ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief LEDButton Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the LEDButton Service with the Battery Level characteristic.
 *          During initialization it adds the LEDButton Service and Battery Level characteristic
 *          to the BLE stack datalbse. Optionally it can also add a Report Reference descriptor
 *          to the Battery Level characteristic (used when including the LEDButton Service in
 *          the HID service).
 *
 *          If specified, the module will support notification of the Battery Level characteristic
 *          through the ble_lbs_battery_level_update() function.
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the LEDButton Service will
 *          generate LEDButton Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note The application must propagate BLE stack events to the LEDButton Service module by calling
 *       ble_lbs_on_ble_evt() from the from the @ref ble_stack_handler callback.
